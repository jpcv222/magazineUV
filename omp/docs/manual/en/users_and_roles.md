OMP offers a flexible user role system that allows you to tailor the roles to your needs. On the Roles tab, you'll see a list of default roles created by the system.

There are many roles and most presses won't need all them. Feel free to delete roles you won't use in your workflow.

You can edit or remove existing roles, or add new roles. All roles are given one of a few permission levels which allow them to perform various actions in the system:

- *Authors* can make new submissions.
- *Reviewers* appear when you're assigning reviews in the [Editorial Workflow](editorial-workflow.md) and have access to that stage when they're assigned.
- *Readers*, like all other user types, can access the reader-facing website. All users have this capability.
- *Press Managers* have access to the entire [Editorial Workflow](editorial-workflow.md), as well as most of the settings.
- *Series Editors* and *Press Assistants* can access only those parts of the [Editorial Workflow](editorial-workflow.md) assigned to their role (see below).

In addition to the permission levels, you can restrict some roles to particular stages of the [Editorial Workflow](editorial-workflow.md). This is useful for professional assistants such as copyeditors or layout managers, who may assist during one or two stages of the workflow.
