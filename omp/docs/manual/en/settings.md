Configure your website to suit your needs from the collection of Settings pages provided by OMP.

You can access the Settings pages by clicking on the **Settings** link in the main navigation menu on the left, then selecting the specific settings page you'd like.

*Only Journal Managers and Administrators can access and edit the settings.*

There's a lot to be uncovered here. While we're improving this documentation, we've provided a quick overview of what each settings page is for, and detailed break-outs for the trickiest options.

## <a name="context"></a>Press

Configure basic details about the press, including contact information, policies, author guidelines, sponsor relationships and more. You can also add Series and Categories to your catalog from this settings page.

## <a name="website"></a>Website

Configure the appearance of your reader-facing website, including logo upload, homepage configuration, sidebar management and more.

You can also set up your site's languages, install and enable plugins, send out announcements and draft key information blocks for visitors.

## <a name="workflow"></a>Workflow

Configure all aspects of the [Editorial Workflow](editorial-workflow.md), including file management, submission guidelines and requirements, peer review deadlines and guidelines, email notifications and much more.

Some of the key settings are broken down in detail below.

### <a name="workflow-components"></a>Components

Your publication files may consist of a number of components, including a book-length manuscript or a chapter-length manuscript, as well as illustrations, glossary, index and more.

When authors and editors upload files to a submission, they will be asked to identify the component of this file.

The Components tab provides a list of common components by default. You are encouraged to add or edit components to suit the particular needs of your press.

Delete those that aren't appropriate for your press. This will reduce the options faced by authors struggling through their first submission.

### <a name="workflow-press-library"></a>Press Library

The Press Library provides a file repository for storing and quickly sharing common files, such as writing guidelines, author contracts and release forms, and marketing materials.

Items that are stored in the Press Library can be quickly retrieved and added into a [Submission Library](editorial-workflow.md#submission-library) to be shared with authors or assistants.

### <a name="workflow-emails"></a>Emails

OMP sends a number of emails during various stages of the [Editorial Workflow](editorial-workflow.md), as well as other actions such as registration and submission acknowledgement.

The settings in this section allow you to tailor the common header and signature that accompany those emails, as well as update the email defaults for each type of email that's sent out.

If you're unsure what a particular email is for, spin out it's context menu by clicking the toggle to the left of the email, and then click **Edit Email**. Most emails include a short description of when they're sent.

*If you want to restore an email template to it's default, use the __Reset__ link to restore defaults.*

## <a name="distribution"></a>Distribution

Configure settings related to your search engine indexing, any payments if you're taking them, and permissions and licensing details for publications.

In the Permissions tab, you'll find settings for asserting copyright and author licensing.

### <a name="copyright-v-license"></a> What's the difference between Copyright and a License?

The copyright identifies the author or owner of copyright for a published work. For example, Copyright (c) 2016 by Jane Smith.

The license attached to a work will determine the usage rights for the published work. For example, CC-By 4.0 allows the work to be copied, redistributed and adapted for any purpose, even commercially, as long as attribution is given to the copyright holder.

## <a name="users"></a>Users & Roles

Add users, define custom user roles and configure site access options. You can lookup any user from this page.

Under the Site Access tab, you can turn off public user registration, or event limit access to the reader-facing site to registered users.

### <a name="users-roles"></a> Roles

OMP offers a flexible user role system that allows you to tailor the roles to your needs. On the Roles tab, you'll see a list of default roles created by the system.

There are a lot of roles and many presses won't need all the roles. Feel free to delete roles you won't use in your workflow.

You can edit or remove existing roles, or add new roles. All roles are given one of a few permission levels which allow them to perform various actions in the system:

- *Authors* can make new submissions.
- *Reviewers* appear when you're assigning reviews in the [Editorial Workflow](editorial-workflow.md) and have access to that stage when they're assigned.
- *Readers*, like all other user types, can access the reader-facing website. All users have this capability.
- *Press Managers* have access to the entire [Editorial Workflow](editorial-workflow.md), as well as most of the settings.
- *Series Editors* and *Press Assistants* can access only those parts of the [Editorial Workflow](editorial-workflow.md) assigned to their role (see below).

In addition to the permission levels, you can restrict some roles to particular stages of the [Editorial Workflow](editorial-workflow.md). This is useful for professional assistants such as copyeditors, marketers or layout managers, who may assist during one or two stages of the workflow.
